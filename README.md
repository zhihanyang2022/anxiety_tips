# My coding log

- Thinking about how to make yourself more relaxed during coding is very important. If you are more relaxed, you are more productive. For example, breaking a bigger problem into smaller ones make you both more relaxed and more productive. The most stressful coding hours happen when you have to make a lot of decisions with little information of what's working and what's not.

 - When encountering problems that are difficult to solve, we sometimes blame ourselves for not working hard enough or smart enough. However, there can be other reasons, too:
   - The resources we are using are either too little or of bad quality. For example, if you are learning a concept that is completely new to you, you should consult / read / compare at least 5 to 10 different resources before you say you are not smart enough to understand it.
   - Working on a problem for more than 2 hours per day prevents insights. You should always keep in mind that you are a human and you have physical and mental limits.
