# My coding log

- Thinking about how to make yourself more relaxed during coding is very important. If you are more relaxed, you are more productive. For example, breaking a bigger problem into smaller ones make you both more relaxed and more productive. The most stressful coding hours happen when you have to make a lot of decisions with little information of what's working and what's not.
